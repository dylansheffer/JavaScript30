    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // ** Arrays will store a reference not a copy **
    console.log('Players: ' + players);
    console.log('Team: ' + team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // takes every item out of an iterable and put it into an array
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Dylan Sheffer',
      age: 23
    }
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});

    console.log(person);
    console.log(person2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const dylan = {
      name: 'Dylan',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@dylansheffer'
      }
    }

    console.log(dylan);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, dylan);

    // if you want to completely clone an object, look up a deep clone function or use JSON.stringify
    // neither are recommended because they're not super performant
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dylan));
